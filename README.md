# PomodoroText

Pomodoro text is a productivity and time management software for students, alumni, writers, and office workers. This software uses a time-management method in order to optimize the ratio of breaks to work time - therefore allowing for higher efficiency! I've coded this by myself in only a few days, so I hope you enjoy!

Note - the play button denotes a 25 minute interval (work time), while the pause button indicates a 5 minute interval (break time). As well, rich text is supported in-editor but TXT files will nullify the rich text. Happy writing!
