        <hr>
        <p id="leftalign">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PomodoroText is a time-saving and productivity based writing software, as mentioned several times in previous pages. There are many features, such as bold (denoted by a bold B), italic (denoted by an italic I), underline (denoted by an underlined U), and more. As well, saving in TXT Format is supported, and a Pomodoro inspired timing system - the focus of this manual.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="leftalign">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a button (seen as play or pause) is pressed, the bar denoting elapsed time will remain blue. Upon pressing the "play" button, work mode is activated, setting a 25 minute timer and counting down second by second. Upon pressing the "pause" button, break mode is activated, setting a 5 minute timer instead. You are intended to alternate these modes for around 4 "loops", until you get to the 4th break. Then, you may choose to either take a 20 minute break (resetting the timer each 5 minutes) or simply continue with your regular 5 minute break. This will ensure optimal ratio of work time to break time while preventing fatigue.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="leftalign">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we'll discuss saving. Since our save system works in BLOB with txt, rich text is not supported saving-wise. You can save by pressing the export-esque (top-right) button next to the others, and rename the file whatever you'd like before downloading.</p>
