# PomodoroText

Pomodoro text is a productivity and time management software for students, alumni, writers, and office workers. This software uses a time-management method in order to optimize the ratio of breaks to work time - therefore allowing for higher efficiency! I've coded this by myself in only a few days, so I hope you enjoy!

# Notes and afterthoughts
 - the "play" button denotes a 25 minute interval (the time in which you work), while the "pause" button indicates a 5 minute interval (the time in which you rest). As well, rich text is supported in-editor but since we save using TXT, the end result will nullify the rich text. If this inconveniences you, consider switching to an on-device text editor (or deal with the fact that you can't bold text). Happy writing!
